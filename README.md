# Financial-Risk-Analysis-of-Big-4-Accounting-Firms
Analyzed financial and risk trends of Big 4 accounting firms (2020–2025) using Python, performing EDA and visualizations to uncover insights on litigation, market, and operational risks.

Detailed Project Description:
This project is a comprehensive analysis of the financial and operational risks faced by the Big Four accounting firms — Deloitte, PwC, EY, and KPMG — over a six-year period from 2020 to 2025. The goal is to identify key risk patterns, compare firms across various financial indicators, and generate meaningful insights that can aid in risk management and strategic decision-making.

Objectives:
Understand and compare the financial risk exposure of each firm.

Visualize litigation, market, and compliance risk trends.

Assess the impact of external factors (e.g., economic conditions, regulatory changes).

Support stakeholders in identifying areas of concern for better governance.

Dataset Overview:
The dataset includes structured financial and risk-related data for each firm, such as:

Revenue, profit margins, and expense ratios

Risk scores across different categories (litigation, operational, reputational, etc.)

Year-wise changes in key metrics from 2020 to 2025

Technologies Used:
Python

Pandas – for data manipulation

Matplotlib and Seaborn – for data visualization

Jupyter Notebook – for analysis and presentation

Key Analyses & Insights:
Year-wise Risk Trends: Visualizations show how each firm's risk levels evolved year by year.

Comparative Analysis: Risk scores and financial KPIs are compared across all four firms.

Litigation Risk: A separate analysis tracks firms' involvement in legal cases and related financial exposure.

Market Sensitivity: Observed how macroeconomic events influenced risk levels.

Revenue & Profit Trends: Financial health was visualized and correlated with risk scores to uncover patterns (e.g., higher profits with lower operational risk).

Heatmaps & Correlation Matrix: Explored interdependencies among risk factors.
